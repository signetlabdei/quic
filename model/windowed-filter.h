// Implements Kathleen Nichols' algorithm for tracking the minimum (or maximum)
// estimate of a stream of samples over some fixed time interval. (E.g.,
// the minimum RTT over the past five minutes.) The algorithm keeps track of
// the best, second best, and third best min (or max) estimates, maintaining an
// invariant that the measurement time of the n'th best >= n-1'th best.
// The algorithm works as follows. On a reset, all three estimates are set to
// the same sample. The second best estimate is then recorded in the second
// quarter of the window, and a third best estimate is recorded in the second
// half of the window, bounding the worst case error when the true min is
// monotonically increasing (or true max is monotonically decreasing) over the
// window.
//
// A new best sample replaces all three estimates, since the new best is lower
// (or higher) than everything else in the window and it is the most recent.
// The window thus effectively gets reset on every new min. The same property
// holds true for second best and third best estimates. Specifically, when a
// sample arrives that is better than the second best but not better than the
// best, it replaces the second and third best estimates but not the best
// estimate. Similarly, a sample that is better than the third best estimate
// but not the other estimates replaces only the third best estimate.
//
// Finally, when the best expires, it is replaced by the second best, which in
// turn is replaced by the third best. The newest sample replaces the third
// best.
